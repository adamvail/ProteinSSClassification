* WITHHOLD TEST SET (FOR ROC CURVE) FROM EVERYTHING.

* Baseline study
  - Different size of hidden layer (1 hidden layer is all)


* Learning curve
  - Vary number of Hidden layers (**)
  - Vary Hidden layer size (use baseline study #s)
  - vs baseline


* ROC curve
  - for best method (from learning curves) vs baseline.  Use confidence data that we're outputting
  - TODO: confidence data for baseline
  - STEPH: Research confidence levels - how to calculate!
  - ADAM: Preprocessers for confidence data
  - decide by saturday nigth settings for ROC run
  - run on opt
  - STEPH


* Accuracy vs # Iterations:  (For 1, 5, 10 iterations)  -- Show that it improves with more iterations, even if it didn't converge.
  - 2 layer autoencoder.  windows size ?, 15 hidden nodes
  - ADAM


* Interesting questions:
  - what if we vary size of layers (use a decay constant in input or something)?
     *  STEPH
  - is it helpful to connect outputs to intermediate layers or inputs?
     *  ADAM


* If we had time (future work):
  - enforce sparsity on intermediate layers w/
  - window size?  (this is chosen because it is "standard")
  - is it helpful to add biases?
  - ensemble of deep networks (different window sizes)
  - x-fold cross validation


ADAM & STEPH - change to 5-fold
