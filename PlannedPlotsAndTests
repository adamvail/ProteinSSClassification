* WITHHOLD TEST SET (FOR ROC CURVE) FROM EVERYTHING.

* Baseline study
  - Different size of hidden layer (1 hidden layer is all)
  - x-fold cross validation

* Learning curve
  - Vary number of Hidden layers (**)
  - Vary Hidden layer size (use baseline study #s)
  - vs baseline

* ROC curve
  - for best method (from learning curves) vs baseline.  Use confidence data that we're outputting
  - TODO: confidence data for baseline

* Accuracy vs # Iterations:  (For 1, 5, 10 iterations)  -- Show that it improves with more iterations, even if it didn't converge.



* Interesting questions:
  - what if we vary size of layers (use a decay constant in input or something)?
  - is it helpful to connect outputs to intermediate layers or inputs?


* If we had time (future work):
  - enforce sparsity on intermediate layers w/
  - window size?  (this is chosen because it is "standard")
  - is it helpful to add biases?
  - ensemble of deep networks (different window sizes)
